I'm an Associate Professor in Medical Ultrasound, trained in both radiography and sonography, with a passion for teaching, research, and building better futures for students and the healthcare workforce. My work sits at the intersection of clinical practice, education, and innovation, with interests in ultrasound physics, competency-based education, and the evolving role of AI in medical imaging. I remain closely connected to the clinical side of the profession and still enjoy the hands-on aspects of ultrasound practice.

I teach into and coordinate a postgraduate ultrasound program, and I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with some brilliant minds across academia, health, and industry. From clinical studies in obstetrics, paediatrics and abdominal imaging to workforce development and educational initiatives, I enjoy research that makes a real-world impact.

I’m currently interested in understanding more about the interaction between humans and machines in the age of AI, particularly how AI may influence clinical decision-making, trust, and shifts in workforce roles. I’m also interested in how we can continue to assess learning in ways that reflect the complexity and authenticity of real-world clinical practice.

Outside of academia, I’m a runner, amateur guitarist, and an explorer of history, especially the parts I never discovered in high school. Music has long been a creative outlet for me, offering a welcome contrast to the dissonance of research and teaching. Whether it’s a long run, a punk riff, or a deep dive into the past, I find these pursuits help me stay curious and grounded.

This site is a place where I share updates on research, thoughts on the sonography profession, and the odd blog post or reflection. Whether you're a student, collaborator, or curious wanderer — welcome.
