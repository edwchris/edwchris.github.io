Here’s my training plan for April — 12 weeks out from **Gold Coast Marathon 2025**. I’ll post the May and June plans a bit later depending on how I’m travelling — time and fitness-wise.

The current focus is on keeping things manageable, with the exception of Thursdays — which should feel pretty tough. Saturdays and Sundays start to introduce some marathon pace (MP) efforts, but nothing overwhelming just yet. 

### Training Notes

- **Thursdays are hard.** That’s deliberate. The rest of the week should feel sustainable.
- **Missing a running session occasionally is fine.** Missing gym work is not.
- The next 5-week block will build from this. Expect longer MP blocks on Saturdays and extended MP efforts on Sundays.
