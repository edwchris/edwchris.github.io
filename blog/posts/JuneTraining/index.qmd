I've been slack uploading my training plan, but here‚Äôs the plan ~~for~~ from June ‚Äî as of writing i've ticked of most of this and its now less than 2 weeks from **Gold Coast Marathon 2025**.

This was a tough three weeks, and we had to make some adjustments to fit in with work.

#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

# Load your data
df <- read_excel("data/June.xlsx")

# Create gt table
df %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**June Marathon Training Plan üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ**")

    data_row.padding = px(6),
    table.width = pct(100),
    heading.title.font.size = 20,
    heading.subtitle.font.size = 14
  ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
    footnote = md("25 to 30 minute very slow jog on most Fridays if no session"),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = Friday)
  )

### Training Notes

-   13 June + 14 June = 36km at marathon pace total. The 16km on the 13th* was fine but the 20k on the 14th^ was a real struggle.

-   14 June was the peak. Then it was a matter of keeping fit and injury free.

Following on from a previous post where I explained my training plan had a heavy focus on specificity, ie running a significant portion of weekly kilometres at or near marathon pace. I was curious to dig into the data and see how well I‚Äôd followed that principle.

Below is a summary table of my running since January, categorised by paces - significantly faster than marathon pace (<4:05 min/km) or at or around my goal marathon pace (4:05‚Äì4:20 min/km). Obviously, my actual race pace is still to be determined.

One small caveat: June isn‚Äôt quite over yet, so there may be a few more kilometres to add before month‚Äôs end.

Interesting, early in the year, marathon pace work was virtually absent, just 1.0 km in January and 0.1 km in February, likely reflecting a period of just turing up to the [Watts sessions](https://www.wattsathletics.com.au/). Typically this involves a Tuesday (speed) and Thursday (threshold) session, and both run quicker than MP. But April marked a turning point, and a big jump towards goal pace, and that volume has held steady since, with 62.0 km logged in June so far.
