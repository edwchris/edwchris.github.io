Here’s my training plan for May — 9 weeks out from **Gold Coast Marathon 2025**.

Modified *18/05/2025* to adjust for running the [Noosa Half Marathon](https://runawaynoosamarathon.com.au/race-options/half-marathon/)

### Training Notes

-   Thursdays & Sundays should feel quite hard
-   **Missing a running session occasionally is fine.** Missing gym work is not.
-   Training peak in early/mid-June and then taper time.
