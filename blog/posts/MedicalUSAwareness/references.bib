   abstract = {The main goal of this chapter is to provide a concise but comprehensive review of the ways in which creativity interventions have been used to promote human flourishing, and the level of empirical support these interventions have garnered. As explained above, two types of creativity-based interventions will be described: interventions in which creativity is the main target (and is seen as an end in itself), and interventions in which creativity is used as a tool to increase other aspects of psychological well-being. In addition, the present chapter will mainly focus on the enhancement of "little-c" creativity and "pro-c" creativity (the creativity of professionals), as much of the research on creativity interventions has occurred in these areas. Less research has looked directly at explicitly enhancing "Big-C" creativity. We however agree with Simonton (2002) that "to become full participants in the positive psychology movement, researchers ultimately must produce real improvements in both everyday and genius-grade manifestations of creativity." This chapter concludes by making suggestions and highlighting directions for future research on creativity-based positive interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},
