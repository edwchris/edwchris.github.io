Most years, I will discuss concerns regarding a student with a department or supervisor. At times these are work-related and a larger puzzle involving interpersonal issues. At other times it relates directly to the profession and the fundamental roles and responsibilities. The student appears motivated and fits into the team well; however, they are just not clicking with the science and "art" that good sonographic practice requires. The student appears to be making the same mistakes, even after various interventions. Often, I believe this requires a responsibility from the student to better reflect on the job and let go of some past experiences in other professions. Ultrasound is different even when compared to other complementary imaging modalities. Sometimes adapting to this new environment can be a challenge.


So, what advice would I give to students commencing this journey? Both academically and practically. Here are ten tips for student sonographers, in no particular order and by no means exclusive. Others may have further additions.

## 1. Leave the ego at the door.

You are learning something new; you will stumble and sometimes stuff things up and fail. Mistakes will be made, which may directly impact patient care. This is just part of the process. Sonography is hard and involves a manifold set of skills that need to come together in synergy for success. The combination of psychomotor, cognitive clinical reasoning and communication skills is unique to the profession, requiring significant training. It isn't easy to return to being a little fish as an adult. Success, however, will only come if you are prepared to give in and embrace the learning process. Just because you have excelled in another discipline does not mean you will be ahead of the curve. At times you need to focus hard and challenge yourself to force the mental adaptations to move to the next level. This is uncomfortable and will expose vulnerabilities. It will be painful and dint the ego, but a necessity.

## 2. Seek excellence, not mastery.

Mastery is a myth, and even the greats will say there are always aspects of their profession, sport, or art they can improve. Develop a willingness to push the boundaries continuously and strive for improvement. Research in the field of skills development identifies a risk of plateauing after a certain level, as individuals become "comfortable" [@ericsson2008]. Embrace professional growth now and throughout your careers. Observe those colleagues you admire in the profession. Undoubtedly, you will find good practice routines, a deep enjoyment in what they do, and a general curiosity in medicine and healthcare. Talent or magic is not part of the equation.

## 3. Become a technology expert.

Good sonographers should strive to be experts in the technology they use. Image optimisation is at the heart of what we do, and a good exam is a synergy between what both hands are doing. One is scanning the patient, the other constantly striving to improve image quality. It is not like a stethoscope, and such analogies should be left to other groups with disparate needs or avoided entirely. Sonographers are coupled to the technology in which success is predicated on a fundamental understanding of correct optimisation strategies. Get to the heart of how the technology works and understand fully what all those wonderful buttons on the machine actually do. Search the settings on your device, setup up your own pre-sets and make the machine sing. You are trying to tell a story for each exam, and the best storytellers utilised good cinematography. A picture tells a thousand words. Suppose you don't know what a particular setting does or how it should be optimised. Ask! A good source is your friendly applications specialist. They have access to excellent resources and white papers that provide analysis on many elements of the technology.

## 4. Develop a flexible systematic scanning approach (with a dash of healthy scepticism)

Ultrasound imaging is not simply a procedure requiring a series of pre-determined tasks to be completed in sequence. Imaging protocols only provide a framework. Too often, a student can miss the forest for trees. Listen to what your patient says, ask them, "why they came into the department today?". Does their answer line up with the imaging request? Is there a need to extend the examination or focus more on one aspect? Sonographers need to adapt and be flexible to best answer the clinical question, using alternative image modes, transducers, or variations to the usual patient positioning maneuvers. Even advanced communication skills are the difference between the success or failure of the exam. In a recent article on the impacts of AI, it became clear to my colleagues and me that many elements of what a sonographer does will be difficult for machines to replicate [@edwards2022]. Many are unique to human cognitive understanding and common-sense reasoning. Be systematic in the approach to each organ or region and be critical in the observations you make. Ask yourself if what you are seeing is a true reflection of reality. Ultrasound images are tricky to interpret at times, and a healthy dash of scepticism may alert you to an artifact rather than a significant pathology. Re-read point 3 above.

## 5. Embrace your peers

Postgraduate ultrasound education should not be viewed as a top-down approach. Learning will not flow exclusively from your supervisors or lecturers at university. Some of the best advice will come from other students or recent graduates. These people often provide a more nuanced or relatable interpretation of the learning process. A sonographer with 30 years of experience is a wealth of knowledge, but at times, that lightbulb moment will come from a fellow student that explains something at your level. The importance of peer learning is increasingly being embedded into postgraduate university programs and has benefits beyond the traditional lecturerâ€“student relationship. Employing students as partners promotes metacognition and a sense of interconnectedness. Form a study group and actively engage other students in your program. Also, be confident that your ideas and interpretations matter; a good supervisor/teacher enjoys both teaching and learning from their students.

## 6. Seek feedback and be proactive

Take responsibility for your learning. Read your reports and follow up cases that interest you. Regularly engage your colleagues, and if there is an element you would like assistance with, ask for it! Ultrasound departments are hectic, complex environments and students need to use their initiative to enhance their training. Ultrasound training is a privilege and a fantastic opportunity few people get. Don't remain a passive observer; help out where you can when times are busy, and use your time wisely during quiet periods. Seek feedback from all members of the health care team. Learn from radiologists, cardiologists and other imaging specialists, talk to referrers and gain insights from a wide network.

## 7. Reflect on the journey in the early stage.

Sonography training is difficult and stressful; this is the truth. Success will require you to manage these in the short term to realise your long-term goals. However, there must be an element of enjoyment in what you do. Struggling in a profession that you learn is the wrong fit has no benefit. The investment in a single student for a department is massive. It won't take long to understand what is required and what the future holds. If you realise the career is not for you, step away and pursue something better suited. There is no shame in this, and it demonstrates a level of insight and maturity.

## 8. Be a scholar

As a university student, read the academic literature and think critically about what you have read. Read full-text articles and don't simply rely on headlines distilling the virtues of ultrasound. Ultrasound technology does not need to be marketed. It needs to be understood. It is not without its flaws and has many. Understand the limitations and advantages, when it should be employed to improve patient care and when to be avoided. Engage with your professional bodies such as ASA and ASUM. But also challenge them to promote factually correct information backed by peer-reviewed research. If an organisation shares information, check who wrote it and search out and read the research paper. A good paper will discuss any limitations missed in the headline. For example, "the participants in the study were trained athletes and do not represent the broader population". If a link does not contain direct access to the entire research paper, ask for it or search directly and share it. Suppose the journal paper is behind a pay-wall. In that case, university research repositories, such as QUT ePrints, or national databases such as PubMed.gov often have agreements with the publisher to provide full-text approved versions of papers.

## 9. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Skills development in ultrasound takes many hours of practice. Be patient. There will be periods where nothing seems to stick, and at others, we hit a period of solid progress, and everything is clicking into gear. Volume and "time in the saddle" are essential components. Consistent regular practice will always trump blocks of training in the long term. Avoid long periods away and line up your periods of academic work with clinical experience. The aim is to embed a deep understanding of the profession. Competency is not an independent list of skills and knowledge; it combines these.

## 10. Be kind to yourself.

The job is taxing both physically and mentally. The adage of "work hard, play hard" is dead. Productivity in any profession relies on adequate relaxation and plenty of sleep. World-class athletes don't focus solely on intense training; they also plan sufficient rest and recovery. A combination of both is required for long term growth and improvement. Even God rested on the seventh day. Exercise and a good diet also play a part, and both have broad health benefits.
