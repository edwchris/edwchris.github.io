   abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology within the health industry is increasing. This educational piece discusses the implementation of AI and its impact on sonography. The authors investigate how AI may influence the profession and provide examples of how ultrasound imaging may be enhanced and innovated by integrating AI technology. This article highlights challenges related to the application of AI and provides insight into how they could be addressed. The critical distinction between the role of a sonographer and the reporting specialist in the context of AI is highlighted as a key issue for those developing, researching, and evaluating AI systems. A key recommendation is for the sonography community to address ultrasound education, particularly how AI knowledge could be incorporated into university education. This is an important consideration that should be extended to practising professionals as they may be involved in evaluating the efficiency and methodologies used in new research that may incorporate AI technologies.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, professional expertise has been judged by length of experience, reputation, and perceived mastery of knowledge and skill. Unfortunately, recent research demonstrates only a weak relationship between these indicators of expertise and actual, observed performance. In fact, observed performance does not necessarily correlate with greater professional experience. Expert performance can, however, be traced to active engagement in deliberate practice (DP), where training (often designed and arranged by their teachers and coaches) is focused on improving particular tasks. DP also involves the provision of immediate feedback, time for problem-solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance to refine behavior. In this article, we draw upon the principles of DP established in other domains, such as chess, music, typing, and sports to provide insight into developing expert performance in medicine.},
