  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of four different training periodizations, based on two different training intensity distributions during a 16-week training block in well-trained endurance runners. Sixty well-trained male runners were divided into four groups. Each runner completed one of the following 16-week training interventions: a pyramidal periodization (PYR); a polarized periodization (POL); a pyramidal periodization followed by a polarized periodization (PYR → POL); and a polarized periodization followed by a pyramidal periodization (POL → PYR). The PYR and POL groups trained with a pyramidal or polarized distribution for 16 weeks. To allow for the change in periodization for the PYR → POL and POL → PYR groups, the 16-week intervention was split into two 8-week phases, starting with pyramidal or polarized distribution and then switching to the other. The periodization patterns were isolated manipulations of training intensity distribution, while training load was kept constant. Participants were tested pre-, mid- and post-intervention for body mass, velocity at 2 and 4 mmol·L−1 of blood lactate concentration (vBLa2, vBLa4), absolute and relative peak oxygen consumption () and 5-km running time trial performance. There were significant group × time interactions for relative (p {$<$} 0.0001), vBLa2 (p {$<$} 0.0001) and vBLa4 (p {$<$} 0.0001) and 5-km running time trial performance (p = 0.0001). Specifically, participants in the PYR → POL group showed the largest improvement in all these variables ( 3.0\% for relative , 1.7\% for vBLa2, 1.5\% for vBLa4, 1.5\% for 5-km running time trial performance). No significant interactions were observed for body mass, absolute , peak heart rate, lactate peak and rating of perceived exertion. Each intervention effectively improved endurance surrogates and performance in well-trained endurance runners. However, the change from pyramidal to polarized distribution maximized performance improvements, with relative representing the only physiological correlate.},

  abstract = {This review aimed to examine the current evidence for 3 primary training intensity distribution types: (1) pyramidal training, (2) polarized training, and (3) threshold training. Where possible, the training intensity zones relative to the goal race pace, rather than physiological or subjective variables, were calculated. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched in May 2017 for original research articles. After analysis of 493 resultant original articles, studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) Their participants were middle- or long-distance runners; (2) they analyzed training intensity distribution in the form of observational reports, case studies, or interventions; (3) they were published in peer-reviewed journals; and (4) they analyzed training programs with a duration of 4 wk or longer. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, which included 6 observational reports, 3 case studies, 6 interventions, and 1 review. According to the results of this analysis, pyramidal and polarized training are more effective than threshold training, although the latest is used by some of the best marathon runners in the world. Despite this apparent contradictory finding, this review presents evidence for the organization of training into zones based on a percentage of goal race pace, which allows for different periodization types to be compatible. This approach requires further development to assess whether specific percentages above and below race pace are key to inducing optimal changes.},

  abstract = {Background A typical training plan is a mix of many training sessions with different intensities and durations to achieve a specific goal, like running a marathon in a certain time. Scientific publications provide little specific information to aid in writing a comprehensive training plan. This review aims to systematically and quantitatively analyse the last 12 weeks before a marathon as recommended in 92 sub-elite training plans. Methods We retrieved 92 marathon training plans and linked their running training sessions to five intensity zones. Subsequently, each training plan was grouped based on the total running volume in peak week into high ({$>$} 90 km/ week), middle (65–90 km/week), and low ({$<$} 65 km/week) training volume plan categories. Results In the final 12 weeks before a race, recommended weekly running volume averaged 108 km, 59 km, and 43 km for high, middle, and low distance marathon training plans. The intensity distribution of these plans followed a pyramidal training structure with 15–67–10–5–3\%, 14–63–18–2–3\%, and 12–67–17–2–2\% in zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, for high, middle, and low volume training plans, respectively. Conclusions By quantitatively analysing 92 recommended marathon training plans, we can specify typical recommendations for the last 12 weeks before a marathon race. Whilst this approach has obvious limitations such as no evidence for the effectiveness of the training plans investigated, it is arguably a useful strategy to narrow the gap between science and practice.},

  abstract = {Endurance athletes integrate four conditioning concepts in their training programs: high-volume training (HVT), “threshold-training” (THR), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and a combination of these aforementioned concepts known as polarized training (POL). The purpose of this study was to explore which of these four training concepts provides the greatest response on key components of endurance performance in well-trained endurance athletes. Methods: Forty eight runners, cyclists, triathletes, and cross-country skiers (peak oxygen uptake: (VO2peak): 62.6 ± 7.1 mL·min−1·kg−1) were randomly assigned to one of four groups performing over 9 weeks. An incremental test, work economy and a VO2peak tests were performed. Training intensity was heart rate controlled. Results: POL demonstrated the greatest increase in VO2peak (+6.8 ml·min·kg−1 or 11.7\%, P \&lt; 0.001), time to exhaustion during the ramp protocol (+17.4\%, P \&lt; 0.001) and peak velocity/power (+5.1\%, P \&lt; 0.01). Velocity/power at 4 mmol·L−1 increased after POL (+8.1\%, P \&lt; 0.01) and HIIT (+5.6\%, P \&lt; 0.05). No differences in pre- to post-changes of work economy were found between the groups. Body mass was reduced by 3.7\% (P \&lt; 0.001) following HIIT, with no changes in the other groups. With the exception of slight improvements in work economy in THR, both HVT and THR had no further effects on measured variables of endurance performance (P \&gt; 0.05). Conclusion: POL resulted in the greatest improvements in most key variables of endurance performance in well-trained endurance athletes. THR or HVT did not lead to further improvements in performance related variables.},
