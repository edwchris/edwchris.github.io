    "text": "For all the GPS data, lactate curves, and laboratory testing, strange as it may seem, there’s still no gold standard for marathon training. While some interventions—like carbohydrate loading or tapering—can be studied in isolation, the training plan itself remains elusive: more art than science.\nAs an interesting review paper states (Knopp et al. 2024)\n\nKnopp, M, D Appelhans, M Schönfelder, S Seiler, and Henning Wackerhage. 2024. “Quantitative Analysis of 92 12-Week Sub-elite Marathon Training Plans.” Sports Medicine - Open 10 (1): 50. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-024-00717-5.\n\n“..a major challenge is that the training plan is not just one intervention but a complex mix of many ..”\n\nand\n\n“…current marathon training plans are mostly experienced based, occasionally supplemented by evidence-based recommendations such as those related to carbohydrate ingestion”\n\nIn other words, optimal training is some cocktail of long runs, intervals, tempo workouts, recovery days, and taper rituals, handed down from generations past and shaped more by tradition than strict scientific evidence. Unlike a drug intervention, you can’t easily randomise thousands of runners into perfectly controlled training groups for twelve weeks. As a result, much of what guides runners today comes from anecdotal success, coaches’ intuition, and proven practices among running groups.\nIn the face of this evidence gap, it’s fair to say that marathon training is still governed by the simple principle: what works, works. Yet patterns do emerge, especially when you study successful plans.\nOne key aspect worth looking at is how runners distribute training intensity across their weekly mileage. When it comes to endurance training, not all kilometres are created equal. Coaches and exercise physiologists often speak in intensity zones. Although there are several models in the literature, I tend to favour the simplicity (and practicality) of sports scientist Stephen Seiler’s three-zone approach.\n\nZone 1 is the intensity up to the first lactate turn point (~2 mmol/L), roughly around 80% of your maximum heart rate.\nZone 2 sits between the first and second lactate thresholds (2–4 mmol/L), typically around 87% of your HRmax.\nZone 3 is above this, where lactate rises rapidly.\n\nHere’s a nice YouTube video from Stephen Seilers explaining his approach.\nThe percentage of training time spent in each of these three zones forms the basis for many training strategies. Two of the most widely discussed are pyramidal and polarised training.\nPyramidal training builds a broad base of easy miles (about 70–80% in Zone 1), with the remainder spread between Zones 2 and 3. The name comes from the pyramid-like shape: most training at low intensity, less at moderate, and even less at high intensity. Interestingly, this pattern matches the structure of many published marathon training plans (Knopp et al. 2024).\nPolarised training, by contrast, pushes the extremes: lots of low-intensity running (Zone 1), some high-intensity efforts (Zone 3), and very little training in the moderate Zone 2. In one intervention study, the polarised model delivered the largest performance gains in well-trained athletes (Stöggl and Sperlich 2014).\n\nStöggl, T, and B Sperlich. 2014. “Polarized Training Has Greater Impact on Key Endurance Variables Than Threshold, High Intensity, or High Volume Training.” Frontiers in Physiology 5 (February). https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2014.00033.\n\n\nThe science on which is optimal is promising but far from settled. A systematic review found that both polarised and pyramidal approaches outperformed threshold-heavy (Zone 2-focused) plans but couldn’t definitively crown a winner (Kenneally, Casado, and Santos-Concejero 2018). More recent research even suggests a periodised blend (another “P” word)—starting pyramidal and shifting toward polarised—may offer the best of both worlds (Filipas et al. 2022).\n\nKenneally, M, A Casado, and Jordan Santos-Concejero. 2018. “The Effect of Periodization and Training Intensity Distribution on Middle- and Long-Distance Running Performance: A Systematic Review.” International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance 13 (9): 1114–21. https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2017-0327.\n\nFilipas, L, M Bonato, G Gallo, and R Codella. 2022. “Effects of 16 Weeks of Pyramidal and Polarized Training Intensity Distributions in Well-Trained Endurance Runners.” Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports 32 (3): 498–511. https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.14101.\nIn short: intensity distribution matters. But how you mix it, like so much in running, depends on timing, experience, and knowing when to hold back and when to push.\nCurious about my own training, I took a quick peek at my data.\nTaking a spherical cow 1 approach to vastly simplify things (perhaps to my folly!), I scaped my recent running data from Garmin Connect and imported it into R. In the data.frame I have computed three Zones (Z1, Z2, Z3) using the Avg.HR for each lap. My watch is currently set to lap every 1km. For each zone I inferred guesstimated my HR ranges based on my current probable HRmax of around 180bpm.\n1 The “spherical cow” is a funny way of describing how scientists sometimes oversimplify complex problems into neat, potentially unrealistic models. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cowRoughly for April my distribution is fairly pyramidal ( 77% Z1, 16% Z2, 7% Z3).\nOutput below, and I am keen to track these distributions leading into the race.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# Calculate percentage of time and distance in each Zone\n\nzone_summary &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Zones, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Time = sum(Time_seconds, na.rm = TRUE),          # Total time in each zone\n    Total_Distance = sum(Distance, na.rm = TRUE)          # Total distance in each zone\n  ) %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Percentage_Time = 100 * Total_Time / sum(Total_Time),  # Percentage of total time\n    Percentage_Distance = 100 * Total_Distance / sum(Total_Distance) # Percentage of total distance\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Display April Table\n\nzone_summary %&gt;% filter(Month == \"April\") %&gt;% gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZones\nMonth\nTotal_Time\nTotal_Distance\nPercentage_Time\nPercentage_Distance\n\n\n\n\nZ1\nApril\n68671.5\n203.29\n77.041781\n71.302304\n\n\nZ2\nApril\n14425.0\n56.34\n16.183245\n19.760794\n\n\nZ3\nApril\n6038.9\n25.48\n6.774974\n8.936902\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nzone_summary &lt;- zone_summary %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Zones = factor(Zones, levels = c(\"Z3\", \"Z2\", \"Z1\")),  # Controls stacking\n  )\n\n# Just April\n\nzone_summary_april &lt;- zone_summary %&gt;% \n  filter(Month == \"April\")\n\nzone_colours &lt;- c(\n  \"Z1\" = \"#ffbf00\",\n  \"Z2\" = \"#f27c23\",\n  \"Z3\" = \"#e24a6f\"\n)\n\nggplot(zone_summary_april, aes(x = Month, y = Percentage_Time, fill = Zones)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = zone_colours,\n    breaks = c(\"Z1\", \"Z2\", \"Z3\")  # Reorder the legend\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Training Time Distribution by Zone (April)\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Time (%)\",\n    fill = \"Zone\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")\n  )"

    "text": "QUT Gardens Point Campus - Brisbane Australia\nMost years, I will discuss concerns regarding a student with a department or supervisor. At times these are work-related and a larger puzzle involving interpersonal issues. At other times it relates directly to the profession and the fundamental roles and responsibilities. The student appears motivated and fits into the team well; however, they are just not clicking with the science and “art” that good sonographic practice requires. The student appears to be making the same mistakes, even after various interventions. Often, I believe this requires a responsibility from the student to better reflect on the job and let go of some past experiences in other professions. Ultrasound is different even when compared to other complementary imaging modalities. Sometimes adapting to this new environment can be a challenge.\nSo, what advice would I give to students commencing this journey? Both academically and practically. Here are ten tips for student sonographers, in no particular order and by no means exclusive. Others may have further additions."

This is just part of the process. Sonography is hard and involves a manifold set of skills that need to come together in synergy for success. The combination of psychomotor, cognitive clinical reasoning and communication skills is unique to the profession, requiring significant training. It isn’t easy to return to being a little fish as an adult. Success, however, will only come if you are prepared to give in and embrace the learning process. Just because you have excelled in another discipline does not mean you will be ahead of the curve. At times you need to focus hard and challenge yourself to force the mental adaptations to move to the next level. This is uncomfortable and will expose vulnerabilities. It will be painful and dint the ego, but a necessity."

It is not like a stethoscope, and such analogies should be left to other groups with disparate needs or avoided entirely. Sonographers are coupled to the technology in which success is predicated on a fundamental understanding of correct optimisation strategies. Get to the heart of how the technology works and understand fully what all those wonderful buttons on the machine actually do. Search the settings on your device, setup up your own pre-sets and make the machine sing. You are trying to tell a story for each exam, and the best storytellers utilised good cinematography. A picture tells a thousand words. Suppose you don’t know what a particular setting does or how it should be optimised. Ask! A good source is your friendly applications specialist.

    "text": "4. Develop a flexible systematic scanning approach (with a dash of healthy scepticism)\nUltrasound imaging is not simply a procedure requiring a series of pre-determined tasks to be completed in sequence. Imaging protocols only provide a framework. Too often, a student can miss the forest for trees. Listen to what your patient says, ask them, “why they came into the department today?”. Does their answer line up with the imaging request? Is there a need to extend the examination or focus more on one aspect? Sonographers need to adapt and be flexible to best answer the clinical question, using alternative image modes, transducers, or variations to the usual patient positioning maneuvers. Even advanced communication skills are the difference between the success or failure of the exam. In a recent article on the impacts of AI, it became clear to my colleagues and me that many elements of what a sonographer does will be difficult for machines to replicate (Edwards et al. 2022). Many are unique to human cognitive understanding and common-sense reasoning. Be systematic in the approach to each organ or region and be critical in the observations you make. Ask yourself if what you are seeing is a true reflection of reality. Ultrasound images are tricky to interpret at times, and a healthy dash of scepticism may alert you to an artifact rather than a significant pathology. Re-read point 3 above.\n\nEdwards, C., C.

Some of the best advice will come from other students or recent graduates. These people often provide a more nuanced or relatable interpretation of the learning process. A sonographer with 30 years of experience is a wealth of knowledge, but at times, that lightbulb moment will come from a fellow student that explains something at your level. The importance of peer learning is increasingly being embedded into postgraduate university programs and has benefits beyond the traditional lecturer–student relationship. Employing students as partners promotes metacognition and a sense of interconnectedness. Form a study group and actively engage other students in your program. Also, be confident that your ideas and interpretations matter; a good supervisor/teacher enjoys both teaching and learning from their students."

Ultrasound training is a privilege and a fantastic opportunity few people get. Don’t remain a passive observer; help out where you can when times are busy, and use your time wisely during quiet periods. Seek feedback from all members of the health care team.

Engage with your professional bodies such as ASA and ASUM. But also challenge them to promote factually correct information backed by peer-reviewed research. If an organisation shares information, check who wrote it and search out and read the research paper. A good paper will discuss any limitations missed in the headline. For example, “the participants in the study were trained athletes and do not represent the broader population”. If a link does not contain direct access to the entire research paper, ask for it or search directly and share it. Suppose the journal paper is behind a pay-wall.

    "text": "“All models are wrong, but some are useful.”1 — George Box\n1 quote generally attributed to George E. P. Box, a British statistician, who argued models are never perfect by may still be useful in everyday life\nBefore diving into the training data, let’s take a quick detour into the curious, and sometimes overly optimistic, world of race prediction models. Most runners have come across these at some point: you plug in a recent race result, hit “calculate,” and voilà — a predicted marathon time appears!\nThe Riegel equation2, or some variation of it, is perhaps the most well-known. It uses a race result over a known distance to estimate a predicted finish time for another distance, based on an exponential decay formula.\n2 proposed by Peter Riegel in a Runner’s World article in 1977Specifically, the formula is:\n\\[\nT_2 = T_1 \\times \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^b\n\\] Where:\nT₁ = time over distance D₁\nT₂ = predicted time over distance D₂\nb = decay exponent - originally proposed by Riegel to be 1.06\nSome more sober-minded folks argue the exponent should be higher—closer to 1.15—and you can read more about the logic behind that in the linked article - see: FetchEveryone’s improved Riegel calculator . Running watches also provide predictors. Mine, a Garmin, currently pegs my marathon fitness at 3:11:xx. Where it gets this number from is anyone’s guess. Presumably a mix of VO₂ max estimates, and recent efforts.\nBut there are other prediction methods that draw on your training data rather than race results. After sharing my past marathon times in a previous post, I started wondering how well the training leading into those races actually correlated with my finish times.\nEnter Tanda.\nDeveloped by Giovanni Tanda from the University of Genova, this model is based on actual training data, not race times. His 2011 paper(Tanda 2011) looked at a bunch of training logs and used regression analysis to see what best predicted marathon pace (and by extension marathon finish time).\n\nTanda, Giovanni. 2011. “Prediction of Marathon Performance Time on the Basis of Training Indices.” Journal of Human Sport and Exercise 6 (3): 511–20. https://doi.org/10.4100/jhse.2011.63.05.\nThe result? For the 8 weeks leading into the final week of training, the paper excluded the final taper week, the two key variables that correlated best with finish times were:\n• K = average weekly distance (km/week)\n• P = average training pace (sec/km)\nThere are, of course, some obvious limitations to the study. It included a modest number of runners (and only one female), and it didn’t attempt to correlate performance with things like individual VO₂ max, lactate threshold, body composition, or biomechanics—factors that are known to influence performance.\nChristof Schwiening has written a brilliant blog exploring the Tanda model in depth, for those keen to venture further down the rabbit hole. One of his best analogies compares Tanda nicely to other race predictors:\n\n“…the Tanda 8-week period is just another race. It is the training race – a race with no defined distance or time, but a race nevertheless.”3\n3 Understanding race predictors - Riegel versus Tanda - Christof Schwiening blog\nFor me, it was just an interesting exercise to see how the model held up. So I went full archaeologist on the 8 weeks leading into all 12 previous marathons. I dug up the P and the K, and ran the Tanda model for each.\nBelow is the output\n\n\nCode\ntanda_data %&gt;%\n  select(Race, Avg_Dist_week_K,\n         Predicted_Time, Pace, Time, Difference, Over_Under_Tanda) %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Marathon Performance vs Tanda Prediction\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Training Summary\",\n    columns = c(Avg_Dist_week_K, Pace)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Race Performance\",\n    columns = c(Predicted_Time, Time, Difference, Over_Under_Tanda)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Race = \"Event\",\n    Avg_Dist_week_K = \"Avg Weekly Distance (K, km)\",\n    Pace = \"Training Pace (P, sec/km)\",\n    Predicted_Time = \"Tanda Prediction (hh:mm:ss)\",\n    Time = \"Actual Time (hh:mm:ss)\",\n    Difference = \"Difference (mm:ss)\",\n    Over_Under_Tanda = \"Over/Under\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = Avg_Dist_week_K,\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = Pace,\n    decimals = 0\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\n      \"Tanda equation: $Pm (sec/km) = 17.1 + 140.0 \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-0.0053 \\\\cdot K) + 0.55 \\\\cdot P$\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarathon Performance vs Tanda Prediction\n\n\nEvent\n\nTraining Summary\n\n\nRace Performance\n\n\n\nAvg Weekly Distance (K, km)\nTraining Pace (P, sec/km)\nTanda Prediction (hh:mm:ss)\nActual Time (hh:mm:ss)\nDifference (mm:ss)\nOver/Under\n\n\n\n\nGold Coast\n81.6\n298\n03:11:01\n03:07:47\n03:14\nUnder\n\n\nMelbourne\n76.3\n297\n03:12:31\n03:38:06\n25:35\nOver\n\n\nBoston\n75.9\n294\n03:11:31\n03:05:00\n06:31\nUnder\n\n\nGold Coast\n69.9\n280\n03:08:10\n02:58:12\n09:58\nUnder\n\n\nCaberra\n88.3\n277\n03:00:42\n03:01:21\n00:39\nOver\n\n\nGold Coast\n56.6\n317\n03:27:45\n03:39:26\n11:41\nOver\n\n\nNew York City\n71.3\n290\n03:11:36\n03:17:11\n05:35\nOver\n\n\nGold Coast\n88.4\n309\n03:13:05\n03:33:49\n20:44\nOver\n\n\nGold Coast\n102.4\n290\n03:01:24\n02:52:17\n09:07\nUnder\n\n\nGold Coast\n72.4\n315\n03:21:01\n03:06:49\n14:12\nUnder\n\n\nSydney\n79.8\n319\n03:19:52\n03:23:10\n03:18\nOver\n\n\nGold Coast\n74.9\n297\n03:13:15\n03:06:33\n06:42\nUnder\n\n\n\nTanda equation: (Pm (sec/km) = 17.1 + 140.0 (-0.0053 K) + 0.55 P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not entirely sure how to interpret this. Based on the Tanda predictions, I outperformed the model in half of my races and underperformed in the other half. In other words, it was a coin toss.\nThe Bland–Altman plot4 below doesn’t offer much insight either. There’s no meaningful bias between the Tanda prediction and my actual marathon finish times the blue line howers around 0 on the y-axis. Which I suppose is a good thing.\n4 Wikipedia reference for the Bland- Altman plotWhat’s more concerning is the width of the Limits of Agreement (LoA). The red-dotted lines hovers around ±25 minutes — which is wild. That essentially means there’s 95% “confidence” that my actual time could be anywhere within 25 minutes of the Tanda prediction for any given race build-up. Not exactly razor-sharp guidance.\nAlso, I have a feeling the finishes over 3:30 are skewing the results. Two of those were significant blow-ups — races where things really unravelled in the later stages. The third was more of a social run, where I paced comfortably alongside a mate.\nAll up, it’s a reminder that while models like Tanda can offer a rough guide, they don’t always capture the messiness of the marathon. And maybe that’s the point: running isn’t always about prediction — sometimes it’s about embracing the unknown, the artistry of pacing, the conditions on the day, and that delicate mix of patience and bravery that makes each race its own adventure.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Prepare the data using base conversions\ntanda_ba &lt;- tanda_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Pred_sec = as.numeric(lubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(Predicted_Time))),\n    Time_sec = as.numeric(lubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(Time))),\n    Mean_time = (Pred_sec + Time_sec) / 2,\n    Diff_time = Time_sec - Pred_sec\n  )\n\n# Compute bias and limits of agreement\nbias &lt;- mean(tanda_ba$Diff_time, na.rm = TRUE)\nsd_diff &lt;- sd(tanda_ba$Diff_time, na.rm = TRUE)\nloa_upper &lt;- bias + 1.96 * sd_diff\nloa_lower &lt;- bias - 1.96 * sd_diff\n\n# Custom formatter for x-axis (hh:mm)\nsec_to_hhmm &lt;- function(x) {\n  hours &lt;- floor(x / 3600)\n  minutes &lt;- floor((x %% 3600) / 60)\n  sprintf(\"%02d:%02d\", hours, minutes)\n}\n\n# Create Bland–Altman plot\nBA_plot&lt;- ggplot(tanda_ba, aes(x = Mean_time, y = Diff_time)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = bias, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = loa_upper, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = loa_lower, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    labels = sec_to_hhmm,\n    name = \"Mean of Tanda Prediction and Actual Time (hh:mm)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Difference: Actual - Predicted (sec)\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bland–Altman Plot: Tanda Prediction vs Actual Marathon Time\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nBA_plot"

    "text": "“If you feel bad at 10 miles, you’re in trouble. If you feel bad at 20 miles, you’re normal. If you don’t feel bad at 26 miles, you’re abnormal” 1 — Robert de Castella\n1 Robert de Castella Wikipedia.\nSince I’ve been posting recent training plans, one thing stands out is a definite shift toward marathon pace work. My volume has crept up a little, but the specificity towards marathon paced work has really changed. More long runs with marathon pace segments, more steady-state sessions right around that 4:05–4:20/km range. It’s a deliberate experiment, and I’m curious where it leads.\nBack in 2019, when I ran my marathon PB (2:52), the build-up was strong, but interestingly, I also set PBs in the 5K and 10K. That block had more speed, more threshold, and arguably, more overall fitness. But it had less dedicated work at goal pace. Looking back, I wonder if I left something on the table by not targeting the specific physiological demands of the marathon more closely. Arguably the opposite is true, and pushing harder into those peak zones is a better approach.\nThis time around, I’m trying to tilt the balance the other way. Less top-end sharpness maybe, but more resilience at race pace. Whether that pays off or just wears me down remains to be seen. That’s the trick with marathon training, you’re gambling six to eight weeks in advance.\nOf course, no plan survives contact with the road. I’ve picked up a tight hamstring, so I’ll be backing off for a few days and hoping that’s all it needs. These interruptions are frustrating, but they’re also reminders to be flexible, not just in the schedule, but in mindset. You don’t lose fitness in three days. You do lose perspective if you panic too early.\nThe upside is I have some time to post some data from my training block, especially the changes between Janurary–April. For this period I have been running fairly consistently but it wasn’t until April that marathon pace work started creeping into more and more sessions. It’s been interesting to watch that shift in real-time, and even more interesting to see how the body reacts to it. Marathon Pace work is getting more comfortable that’s for sure.\nThe plot below was created by pulling done my run data from Garmin Connect, extracting the average pace for each lap and grouping them. My watch is set to lap every 1km. This plot is inspired by one of the wonderful plots made by Anatasia Anastasiadou\nApril saw a big jump in the purple marathon-paced zone in the graphic below.\nLoad libraries\n\n\nCode\n# load libraries -------\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(extrafont)\n\n\nLoad data\n\n\nCode\n# load data --------\n\ndf &lt;- fread(\"data/data_comb2.csv\")\n\n\nDataset for plotting\n\n\nCode\n# Create Pace Dataset -----------\n\npace &lt;- df%&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pace_category = cut(\n      pace_sec_per_km,\n      breaks = c(-Inf, 240, 260, 300, 330, Inf),\n      labels = c(\n        \"&lt;4:00 min/km\",\n        \"4:00–4:20 min/km\",\n        \"4:20–5:00 min/km\",\n        \"5:00–5:30 min/km\",\n        \"&gt;5:30 min/km\"\n      ),\n      right = FALSE\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month,pace_category) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Distance_km = sum(Distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Percentage_Distance = round(100 * Total_Distance_km / sum(Total_Distance_km), 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Cleaning -------------\n\npace &lt;- pace %&gt;% filter(Month != \"May\")\n\npace$Month &lt;- factor(pace$Month, levels = c(\"January\", \"February\", \"March\",\"April\"))\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nCode\n# colours-----------\n\n\ngrid_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"&gt;5:30 min/km\"       = \"#5a8192\",  \n  \"5:00–5:30 min/km\"   = \"#c1cbe3\",  \n  \"4:20–5:00 min/km\"   = \"#a4a0d1\",  \n  \"4:00–4:20 min/km\"   = \"#8570b0\",  \n  \"&lt;4:00 min/km\"       = \"#67206f\"   \n)\n\n\np &lt;-  ggplot(pace, aes(x = Month, y = Percentage_Distance, fill = pace_category)) +\n\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.5) +\n   scale_fill_manual(values = grid_colors) +\n\n    labs(\n        title = \"Monthly % Distribution of Kilometres by Pace Zone\",\n        subtitle = \"4:00-4:20 min/km represents target Marathon Pace (MP).\",\n        caption = \" Source: &lt;b&gt; Garmin Connect&lt;/b&gt; | Graphic: &lt;b&gt;Chris Edwards&lt;/b&gt;\",\n        y = \"Distance Run (km)\", \n        fill = \"Type\"\n    ) +\n    \n    theme_minimal(base_family = \"Enriqueta\") +\n    \n    theme(\n        \n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        \n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9),\n        \n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),\n        \n        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),         # Smaller text\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),        # Optional: smaller title\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.8, \"lines\"),         # Smaller boxes\n        legend.spacing.y = unit(0.5, \"lines\"),\n        \n        legend.position = \"right\",\n        \n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey75\", linetype = \"dashed\", lineend = \"round\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        \n        plot.title = element_markdown(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, margin = margin(t = 2, b = 2)),\n        plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 10, hjust = 0.5,  color = \"grey30\", margin = margin(t = 5, b = 10)),\n        plot.caption  = element_markdown(margin = margin(t = 25), size = 6, hjust = 1.28),\n        \n        \n        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20),\n        \n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#e4e4e3\", color = NA) \n    )  +  \n        coord_flip()  \n        \n    \np"

    "text": "Professional Context – AI’s Role in Sonography Practice\nPredicting how this technology will ultimately impact the sonographer’s role is challenging. Some tools may work in the background to improve image quality but others will require direct interactions with the sonographer. Suppose one were to view AI from a purely technical or capability standpoint – for example, a system that employs machine learning to predict an output from text, images, audio or video. With the current level of AI technology, it is perhaps reasonable to suggest that, in a short period, an ultrasound system will be equipped with advanced image analysis tools, possibly automatically labelling anatomy and highlighting a range of pathologies. Further, it may be able to analyse sets of images or videos and compute a report. Regarding audio, perhaps our machines may be equipped with an inbuilt audio interface that will interact with the patient directly, reassuring them that everything is in hand and answering any questions they may have in a professional, empathetic tone. The system may even prompt you if the patient mentions some relevant clinical history, conveniently prefilling these details into an electronic worksheet before you have left the room. What about wholly automated systems using advanced robotics?\nThe world was promised the widespread adoption of driverless cars; Morgan Stanley in 2013 predicted this would occur in 20263. Current predictions have now gone beyond another two decades. This is partly due to the messiness and unpredictability of real life and the difficulty of designing models to cope. In the case of driverless cars, sudden changes in the weather, roadworks, and, of course, other human drivers engage in irrational behaviour on the road. Healthcare is similarly complex, filled with ambiguity, human emotion, and multiple competing elements. AI models must be robust enough to handle these realities. In sonography, this means dealing with everyday realities like extremes of body habitus, low patient acuity, and challenging patient interactions. Sonographers currently address these issues using techniques such as non-standardised plans and advanced communication skills tailored to each patient’s condition and clinical history.\n3 Shanker R, et al. Autonomous cars: Self-driving the new auto industry paradigm. Morgan Stanley blue paper, 2013; 1–109.Various systems will be developed and deployed as technology advances. Following how these systems are implemented and adapted to current healthcare challenges will be interesting. What is clear is that AI systems that make predictions or assist with decision-making cannot be viewed simply in a transactional sense; they are not like calculators involving a simple input and output; it is an interaction that consists of a relationship between the user and the patient (both humans) and the machine. As mentioned above, the success of these systems will be dependent on various patient characteristics but also on how AI relates to individual practitioners. This is about knowing if the tool produces the correct response in the correct setting. In this way, the success of the AI will depend on the practitioner’s experience just as much as its ability to interpret the ultrasound machine’s output. In one scenario, an expert sonographer may quickly identify an error in the AI output, whereas a student or newly qualified sonographer may take the output on trust. AI interactions will require a delicate balance between trust and scepticism. Successfully integrating AI into sonography will mean navigating this new reality."

    "text": "Sonography Education – Balancing AI Tools and Integrity\nThe impacts of AI in the sonography profession are likely to be gradual. However, their effect on education, including sonography education, has more immediate implications. Generative AI (GenAI), the term used to describe AI that can create new content, is capable of completing many student tasks with high accuracy, making it one of the most disruptive technologies ever seen in education. The latest ChatGPT release, o1-preview, designed explicitly for advanced logic and reasoning, is reported to perform at the PhD level4.\n4 OpenAI. Introducing OpenAI o1-preview. https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/5 Parliament of Australia. Inquiry into the use of generative artificial intelligence in the Australian education system ‘Study Buddy or Influencer’. 2024 https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Employment_Education_and_Training/AIineducation/Report6 Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. Artificial intelligence request for information – next steps. 2024.https://www.teqsa.gov.au/about-us/news-and-events/latest-news/artificial-intelligence-request-information-next-stepsMultiple authorities are wrestling with the impacts. A parliamentary senate inquiry report, ‘Study Buddy or Influencer’, was released in August 2024, recommending GenAI in education be made a national priority5. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), the national regulatory body of universities, has requested urgent action, asking all institutions to report on how they manage GenAI, particularly how they address the risk of GenAI to award integrity6.\nUniversities themselves also understand the reputational risks and potential for significant community backlash, for example, graduates from a particular university who enter the workforce without the competence to perform the job effectively and safely. This is especially critical in fields like sonography and other health degrees, where universities self-certify their students. Once they graduate, there is no post-qualification check to ensure that the skills they reportedly gained meet community expectations.\nWith these considerations in mind and TEQSA having one eye firmly on risk, an urgent overhaul of assessment practices is underway. Of course, some assessments are designed to assist and promote learning, and AI tools will become welcome additions. Other, high-stakes assessments designed to verify student learning, which directly leads to certifying a degree like sonography, will require rigorous direct supervision – for example, a return of traditional hall-style written exams to verify knowledge acquisition, oral assessment tasks to demonstrate understanding and showcase communication skills, and face-to-face practical evaluations to demonstrate technical skills.\nMany online assessment methods developed during COVID-19 are now obsolete. Numerous tips and YouTube videos are circulating on how students can use AI tools during online assessments, even when the assessor is present via Teams or Zoom. Some may have already seen videos of job candidates using AI tools to convert an employer’s questions into text responses displayed on a hidden monitor during interviews.\nRisks must be countered with rewards. In the professional world, it is not unreasonable to expect the question of why you used an AI tool to become ‘why not’, especially when there are workflow and efficiency gains and improvements to overall patient care. Therefore, it is incumbent on educators to encourage the use of tools for relevant tasks. In the sonography context, this might be written communication tasks where students produce artefacts (reports, oral case presentations, ePoster) to showcase and share their knowledge with colleagues.\nThe use of AI in learning is also an untapped resource. Feedback literacy, an emerging topic in education to improve student learning outcomes, is one area in which AI may assist. The idea focuses not on how supervisors frame feedback for students but on teaching students to respond positively and integrate feedback into their practice. Feedback comes in various forms; sometimes, it is for evaluation; other times, it is an aid to help the student improve; and at different times, it is for praise on a job well done. All of which are important for growth. How students manage their emotional responses to these three is an important skill to develop. More research is needed, but perhaps AI chatbots may be a good source of feedback literacy development – just a thought.\nAs AI becomes more integrated into sonography and education, the focus must remain on maintaining the integrity of the profession and upholding community trust in practitioners. While these tools offer potential, ensuring that they enhance rather than replace human judgement and accountability is essential to preserving the core values of patient care and professional competence."

    "section": "",
    "text": "October is Medical Ultrasound Awareness Month, and the 27th of October is Australasian Sonographers Day. These are fantastic opportunities to bring the public closer to the incredible ultrasound technology and highlight the essential role sonographers play in modern healthcare. Unlike many imaging techniques, the success of ultrasound examinations depends heavily on the sonographer’s skills, intuition, and expertise. This unique relationship between humans and machines presents challenges and remarkable rewards for those in the profession.\n\nThe sonography profession faces several significant challenges today. Increasing demand for imaging services, an overstretched workforce, and a lack of professional recognition are just a few of the difficulties. Furthermore, ongoing concerns about workplace health and safety, alongside a chronic lack of training opportunities for the next generation have compounded the pressures on the field. While none of these challenges have easy solutions, focusing solely on the obstacles would overlook the incredible aspects of sonography that continue to make it a deeply rewarding career. So, what makes this profession so special? Here are three reasons.\n\nThe Joy of Mastering a Challenge\nOne of the most fulfilling aspects of sonography is its inherent complexity. Mastering the skill takes years, and excellence can take decades, but that journey is what makes it so satisfying. John F. Kennedy once said of the quest to land on the moon,\n\n“…not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept…”\n\nThis resonates with sonographers, who are challenged to perform complex tasks daily. Each examination demands technical precision, an understanding of human anatomy, and zero-latency decision-making. The sonographer must simultaneously manipulate the ultrasound probe, adjust the ultrasound beam, interpret numerous images in real-time, and engage with the patient to ensure their comfort and cooperation. It is a dance of skill and intuition, with the patient always at the center of the experience.\nAs one paper described sonography, it is “25% art, 25% knowledge, and 50% public relations.”(Mulkey 2005) Every exam is different, requiring a mix of creativity, problem-solving, and a deep connection with the patient. It may look easy to outsiders, but those in the field know the truth—this is a job for those who thrive on challenges.\n\nMulkey, Allen. 2005. “Sonography Clinical Education.” Journal Article. Journal of Diagnostic Medical Sonography 21 (3): 273–75. https://doi.org/10.1177/8756479305277571.\n\n\nCreativity in Practice\nSonography is far from a rote or a procedural profession. Every patient presents a new puzzle, and sonographers rely on their creativity for the best results. Ultrasound machines don’t know where to find the best images; it’s up to the sonographer’s skill and intuition to locate the ideal window, angle, or imaging plane. This makes every exam a creative act as much as a technical one.\nThe literature is full of evidence that engaging in creative activities enhances happiness and well-being (Forgeard and Eichner 2014), and sonography offers a constant opportunity to apply that creativity in real-world settings. It’s not just the technology of ultrasound that tells the story; it’s the sonographer’s ability to shape a diagnostic story through creative exploration.\n\nForgeard, Marie J. C., and Katherine V. Eichner. 2014. “Creativity as a Target and Tool for Positive Interventions.” Book Section. In The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Positive Psychological Interventions., 137–54. Hoboken, NJ, US: Wiley Blackwell. https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118315927.ch7.\n\n\nThe Human Touch in a Technological World\nWhile AI is reaching the stage where it can support image optimisation and analysis, it cannot replace the nuanced expertise required to operate ultrasound technology effectively. The skill of the sonographer lies in the technical manipulation of the transducer, adjusting dynamically for patient anatomy and in their ability to interpret real-time images and make rapid decisions based on clinical context. These capabilities, combined with a sonographer’s ability to communicate with and reassure patients, cannot be easily automated (at least not yet!)\nFor example, in obstetric imaging, the experience is highly personal. Expectant families rely on the sonographer’s expertise to ensure the best care, trusting that their diagnostic decisions are informed by years of training, hands-on practice, and clinical judgment. While AI tools may assist in tasks like identifying anomalies or labeling anatomical features, the human connection and judgment required to achieve diagnostic accuracy remain critical. Sonography, unlike many other imaging fields, relies on the synergy between human touch and technology."

    "text": "“I have been bent and broken, but I hope into a better shape.”\n— Charles Dickens\n\nSince my last post in May, the training block has kept ticking along, more or less to plan. The hamstring niggle that flared up in mid-May thankfully settled down (touch wood). But it’s done its job as a persistent reminder: don’t skimp on the gym work. These days, I’m locked into two lower body sessions a week. Nothing flashy, just the essentials to hopefully to keep the tight hamstring at bay. The rest of the body can wait until after the marathon.\nThe standout recently? A half marathon in Noosa. I clocked 1:23:20, no PB, but stronger than expected. The plan going in was around 1:25 or 1:26, so it was a pleasant surprise to come home feeling strong. Here’s the Strava link if you’re curious.\nI gave the Saucony Endorphin Elite v2s their debut, and they lived up to the hype. Light, responsive, and aggressive. There’s always a temptation to overinterpret a good half marathon performance, but I’m trying to keep it in context. I’ve done more marathon specific work than ever before this cycle, so while the shorter race results might not be razor sharp, the hope is that the engine is better tuned for the full 42.2.\nI also recently listened to an episode of Eat Sleep Run Repeat1, a podcast produced by some Brisbane based runners which really got me thinking more about specificity. It featured an in-depth interview with coach John Starrett (episode link), who has coached hundreds of sub 3 hour and 2:30 marathoners.\n1 Eat Sleep Run Repeat - Podcast.Starrett’s approach is built around a phased structure that guides athletes from base conditioning through to race readiness. He breaks the training block into distinct segments, what he calls the “Pre-Superbase,” “Superbase,” and “Marathon Bridge,” each with a specific physiological focus. It’s not just about ramping up mileage, it’s about layering fitness in a deliberate and purposeful way.\nWhat really struck me was how much emphasis he places on quality sessions over quantity. He’s definitely not a fan of junk miles. His plans centre around two hard workouts per week that target the specific demands of the marathon, using marathon pace and threshold sessions. That approach made a lot of sense, especially in the context of my own build. Another aspect that stood out was his lack of reliance on frequent tune-up races. Instead, he uses well designed marathon pace workouts to simulate the physical demands of race day. While my own program remains different in structure, I found plenty in that conversation that resonated. The specificity, the structured progress and the idea that fewer races might not be a disadvantage after all. Which was especially relevant after Noosa. The week following the half was tough, significant muscle soreness meant I didn’t get back to full training for several days. The race was on the Saturday. Together with some easy running I only managed a 6 km tempo effort the following Thursday, and then an easy 32 km long run on the following Sunday. A definite confidence builder but a reminder races take their toll and require time to recover.\nI’ll post a breakdown of the June training block soon. There’s definitely been more marathon pace work creeping in, and it’s starting to feel more comfortable. The last few weeks have built into a big weekend, but I’ll save that story for next time."

    "text": "“He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.” 1 — Dr. Samuel Johnson, quoted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson (1971)\n1 Originally by Dr. Samuel Johnson, used by Hunter S. Thompson as the epigraph to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971).\nThis is the beginning of a small experiment — part training log, part data science side project, part nostalgic therapy. After a long and sometimes questionable relationship with the marathon, I’ve decided to document the road to my next one — my 13th, though who’s counting. A “local” marathon, the Gold Coast Marathon and one I’m familiar with. I’m not chasing a personal best (at least, that’s what I tell myself), but I am chasing something: structure, understanding, maybe even redemption. This blog, and the series to follow, is a place to reflect on old performances, track new training efforts, and occasionally make sense of the numbers — or at least dress them up in tidy tables and plots that suggest control over what is an unpredictable pursuit.\nThe marathon doesn’t just test the man — it spawns the beast in him. Not a beast of rage or reckless indulgence, like the one Hunter S. Thompson conjured in the neon haze of Vegas, but something more controlled, more methodical… yet still, undeniably, irrational. To train for a marathon is to willingly embrace a kind of madness: to rise early, log the miles, sweat through long runs, negotiate splits, and obsess over details that no one else will ever see or care about. No different, I suppose, than other, less healthy forms of addition— except that one ends with a finisher’s medal and (hopefully) less liver damage. Still, both blur the lines between discipline and delusion. And both, in their way, are obsessions that allow escape from the polite constraints of ordinary life.\nReflecting on my own running, I haven’t trained “properly” since 2019 — which, not coincidentally, was also my personal best (2:52). A high-water mark that I’ve stared at lovingly (and distortedly) in the rear-view mirror ever since. In the time that followed, both the structure and my resolve slipped. My belief systems about what should work in training have often charged ahead of the evidence. In hindsight, I probably need to be a better Bayesian 2: update my beliefs when the data tells me to, not just when my ego needs a pick-me-up.\n2 For a general introduction to Bayesian inference — the process of updating beliefs as new evidence becomes available — see the Wikipedia article on Bayesian inference.So, why write now?\nPartly because I’m keen to trace the path from start to finish. But also because I’ll “try” and quietly turn this into a small data science project — an excuse to tinker with my training logs, Strava uploads, physiological markers, and the occasional psychological pothole. Maybe there’s something to learn from 12 previous marathons. And really, I just love running — the rhythm, the ritual, the ridiculousness of it all. This is a way to make sense of it, or at least enjoy the attempt.\nIt’s also a chance to learn more about Quarto3 (the system used to create this website), and to explore how to tell a story with better visuals, tables, and a cleaner presentation style. Consider it a running diary meets technical playground — one foot in the marathon world, the other in R markdown.\n3 Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. For documentation and source code, see the official website at quarto.org and the GitHub repository.For background, I’m including some data below to give a snapshot of my past marathon performances, complete with age-graded percentages. It’s a mix of highs and “what the hell happened there?”\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Date, Race, Time, Age, Age_Graded_Percent = Age_Graded) %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Age-Graded Marathon Performances\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = vars(Age_Graded_Percent),\n    decimals = 2,\n    suffixing = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Date = \"Race Date\",\n    Race = \"Event\",\n    Time = \"Finish Time\",\n    Age = \"Age\",\n    Age_Graded_Percent = \"Age-Graded (%)\"\n  )\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-Graded Marathon Performances\n\n\nRace Date\nEvent\nFinish Time\nAge\nAge-Graded (%)\n\n\n\n\n6/07/2014\nGold Coast\n3:07:47\n37\n69.23\n\n\n12/10/2014\nMelbourne\n3:38:06\n37\n59.61\n\n\n20/04/2015\nBoston\n3:05:00\n37\n70.27\n\n\n5/07/2015\nGold Coast\n2:58:12\n38\n72.95\n\n\n10/04/2016\nCanberra\n3:01:21\n38\n71.68\n\n\n3/07/2016\nGold Coast\n3:39:26\n38\n59.24\n\n\n6/11/2016\nNew York City\n3:17:11\n39\n65.93\n\n\n1/07/2018\nGold Coast\n3:33:49\n40\n63.14\n\n\n7/07/2019\nGold Coast\n2:52:17\n42\n78.36\n\n\n3/07/2022\nGold Coast\n3:06:49\n44\n72.26\n\n\n17/09/2023\nSydney\n3:23:10\n46\n69.89\n\n\n7/07/2024\nGold Coast\n3:06:33\n47\n76.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne main difference this time is I’ve handed over the keys to someone else. A friend — and experienced runner — who is guiding my training. So training plan to come. Left to my own devices, I tend to alternate between over-training, under-believing, and ignoring all evidence in favour of whatever romantic training idea is currently floating through my brain. So this time, I’m trying structure. Consistency. Restraint. (I give that three weeks, tops!).\nSo here we are: 13 weeks out. The beginning stages of… I don’t know if I’ll run sub-3 again. But I’ll document the attempt, the process, and the data that drips out along the way. I’m choosing to believe if only for a little while, and at least in this moment it seems worth leaning into.\nLet’s see what happens."
