    "text": "“He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.” 1 — Dr. Samuel Johnson, quoted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson (1971)\n1 Originally by Dr. Samuel Johnson, used by Hunter S. Thompson as the epigraph to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971).\nThis is the beginning of a small experiment — part training log, part data science side project, part nostalgic therapy. After a long and sometimes questionable relationship with the marathon, I’ve decided to document the road to my next one — my 13th, though who’s counting. A “local” marathon, the Gold Coast Marathon and one I’m familiar with. I’m not chasing a personal best (at least, that’s what I tell myself), but I am chasing something: structure, understanding, maybe even redemption. This blog, and the series to follow, is a place to reflect on old performances, track new training efforts, and occasionally make sense of the numbers — or at least dress them up in tidy tables and plots that suggest control over what is an unpredictable pursuit.\nThe marathon doesn’t just test the man — it spawns the beast in him. Not a beast of rage or reckless indulgence, like the one Hunter S. Thompson conjured in the neon haze of Vegas, but something more controlled, more methodical… yet still, undeniably, irrational. To train for a marathon is to willingly embrace a kind of madness: to rise early, log the miles, sweat through long runs, negotiate splits, and obsess over details that no one else will ever see or care about. No different, I suppose, than compulsions of drink and drugs — except that one ends with a finisher’s medal and (hopefully) less liver damage. Still, both require full immersion. Both blur the lines between discipline and delusion. And both, in their way, are a form of mayhem that allows escape from the polite constraints of ordinary life.\nReflecting on my own running, I haven’t trained “properly” since 2019 — which, not coincidentally, was also my personal best (2:52). A high-water mark that I’ve stared at lovingly (and maybe delusionally) in the rear-view mirror ever since. Since then, the structure and my resolve have slipped. My belief systems about what “should work” in training have often charged ahead of the evidence. In hindsight, I probably need to be a better Bayesian 2: update my beliefs when the data tells me to, not just when my ego needs a pick-me-up.\n2 For a general introduction to Bayesian inference — the process of updating beliefs as new evidence becomes available — see the Wikipedia article on Bayesian inference.So, why blog now?\nPartly because I’m nostalgic. But also because I’ll “try” and quietly turn this into a small data science project — an excuse to tinker with my training logs, Strava uploads, physiological markers, and the occasional psychological pothole. Maybe there’s something to learn from 12 previous marathons. And really, I just love running — the rhythm, the ritual, the ridiculousness of it all. This is a way to make sense of it, or at least enjoy the attempt.\nIt’s also a chance to learn more about Quarto 3 (the system used to create this website), and to explore how to tell a story with better visuals, interactive tables, and a cleaner presentation style. I’ve taken a liking to the Tufte handout theme 4, and writing more here gives me a good excuse to experiment with that as well. Consider it a running diary meets technical playground — one foot in the marathon world, the other in markdown.\n3 Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. For documentation and source code, see the official website at quarto.org and the GitHub repository.4 The Tufte theme in Quarto is inspired by Edward Tufte’s design principles, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and effective use of white space. See the Quarto Tufte layout example at quarto-dev.github.io.For background, I’m including a table below that gives a snapshot of my past marathon performances, complete with age-graded percentages. It’s a mix of highs and “what the hell happened there?”\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Date, Race, Time, Age, Age_Graded_Percent = Age_Graded) %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Age-Graded Marathon Performances\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = vars(Age_Graded_Percent),\n    decimals = 2,\n    suffixing = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Date = \"Race Date\",\n    Race = \"Event\",\n    Time = \"Finish Time\",\n    Age = \"Age\",\n    Age_Graded_Percent = \"Age-Graded (%)\"\n  )\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-Graded Marathon Performances\n\n\nRace Date\nEvent\nFinish Time\nAge\nAge-Graded (%)\n\n\n\n\n6/07/2014\nGold Coast\n3:07:47\n37\n69.23\n\n\n12/10/2014\nMelbourne\n3:38:06\n37\n59.61\n\n\n20/04/2015\nBoston\n3:05:00\n37\n70.27\n\n\n5/07/2015\nGold Coast\n2:58:12\n38\n72.95\n\n\n10/04/2016\nCanberra\n3:01:21\n38\n71.68\n\n\n3/07/2016\nGold Coast\n3:39:26\n38\n59.24\n\n\n6/11/2016\nNew York City\n3:17:11\n39\n65.93\n\n\n1/07/2018\nGold Coast\n3:33:49\n40\n63.14\n\n\n7/07/2019\nGold Coast\n2:52:17\n42\n78.36\n\n\n3/07/2022\nGold Coast\n3:06:49\n44\n72.26\n\n\n17/09/2023\nSydney\n3:23:10\n46\n69.89\n\n\n7/07/2024\nGold Coast\n3:06:33\n47\n76.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne main difference this time is I’ve handed over the keys to someone else. A friend — and experienced runner — who is guiding me through the process. So training plan to come. Left to my own devices, I tend to alternate between overtraining, under-believing, and ignoring all evidence in favour of whatever romantic training idea is currently floating through my brain. So this time, I’m trying structure. Consistency. Restraint. (I give that three weeks, tops.).\nSo here we are: 13 weeks out. The beginning stages of… I don’t know if I’ll run sub-3 again. But I’ll document the attempt, the process, and the data that drips out along the way. I’m choosing to believe if only for a little while, and at least in this moment it seems worth leaning into.\nLet’s see what happens."

    "section": "",
    "text": "October is Medical Ultrasound Awareness Month, and the 27th of October is Australasian Sonographers Day. These are fantastic opportunities to bring the public closer to the incredible ultrasound technology and highlight the essential role sonographers play in modern healthcare. Unlike many imaging techniques, the success of ultrasound examinations depends heavily on the sonographer’s skills, intuition, and expertise. This unique relationship between humans and machines presents challenges and remarkable rewards for those in the profession.\n\nThe sonography profession faces several significant challenges today. Increasing demand for imaging services, an overstretched workforce, and a lack of professional recognition are just a few of the difficulties. Furthermore, ongoing concerns about workplace health and safety, alongside a chronic lack of training opportunities for the next generation have compounded the pressures on the field. While none of these challenges have easy solutions, focusing solely on the obstacles would overlook the incredible aspects of sonography that continue to make it a deeply rewarding career. So, what makes this profession so special? Here are three reasons.\n\nThe Joy of Mastering a Challenge\nOne of the most fulfilling aspects of sonography is its inherent complexity. Mastering the skill takes years, and excellence can take decades, but that journey is what makes it so satisfying. John F. Kennedy once said of the quest to land on the moon,\n\n“…not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept…”\n\nThis resonates with sonographers, who are challenged to perform complex tasks daily. Each examination demands technical precision, an understanding of human anatomy, and zero-latency decision-making. The sonographer must simultaneously manipulate the ultrasound probe, adjust the ultrasound beam, interpret numerous images in real-time, and engage with the patient to ensure their comfort and cooperation. It is a dance of skill and intuition, with the patient always at the center of the experience.\nAs one paper described sonography, it is “25% art, 25% knowledge, and 50% public relations.”(Mulkey 2005) Every exam is different, requiring a mix of creativity, problem-solving, and a deep connection with the patient. It may look easy to outsiders, but those in the field know the truth—this is a job for those who thrive on challenges.\n\nMulkey, Allen. 2005. “Sonography Clinical Education.” Journal Article. Journal of Diagnostic Medical Sonography 21 (3): 273–75. https://doi.org/10.1177/8756479305277571.\n\n\nCreativity in Practice\nSonography is far from a rote or a procedural profession. Every patient presents a new puzzle, and sonographers rely on their creativity for the best results. Ultrasound machines don’t know where to find the best images; it’s up to the sonographer’s skill and intuition to locate the ideal window, angle, or imaging plane. This makes every exam a creative act as much as a technical one.\nThe literature is full of evidence that engaging in creative activities enhances happiness and well-being (Forgeard and Eichner 2014), and sonography offers a constant opportunity to apply that creativity in real-world settings. It’s not just the technology of ultrasound that tells the story; it’s the sonographer’s ability to shape a diagnostic story through creative exploration.\n\nForgeard, Marie J. C., and Katherine V. Eichner. 2014. “Creativity as a Target and Tool for Positive Interventions.” Book Section. In The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Positive Psychological Interventions., 137–54. Hoboken, NJ, US: Wiley Blackwell. https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118315927.ch7.\n\n\nThe Human Touch in a Technological World\nWhile AI is reaching the stage where it can support image optimisation and analysis, it cannot replace the nuanced expertise required to operate ultrasound technology effectively. The skill of the sonographer lies in the technical manipulation of the transducer, adjusting dynamically for patient anatomy and in their ability to interpret real-time images and make rapid decisions based on clinical context. These capabilities, combined with a sonographer’s ability to communicate with and reassure patients, cannot be easily automated (at least not yet!)\nFor example, in obstetric imaging, the experience is highly personal. Expectant families rely on the sonographer’s expertise to ensure the best care, trusting that their diagnostic decisions are informed by years of training, hands-on practice, and clinical judgment. While AI tools may assist in tasks like identifying anomalies or labeling anatomical features, the human connection and judgment required to achieve diagnostic accuracy remain critical. Sonography, unlike many other imaging fields, relies on the synergy between human touch and technology."

The training employs a technique called ‘backpropagation’, a type of feedback loop that improves the model’s accuracy. During backpropagation, the model calculates the error between predicted and actual outputs and then uses this error to adjust parameters to improve model performance over time. This could be text in the case of large language models (LLMs) or images and videos.\nSome of the work currently done at QUT, analysing ultrasound images, uses a type of transformer called a Swin Transformer. The Swin Transformer, short for Shifted Window Transformer, is designed to deal with the complexity of image processing. Unlike text, where information flows sequentially, images are spatially located. For example, in medical images, the diagnosis isn’t just in individual pixels but in how these pixels relate to one another across the entire visual field. Ultrasound images are particularly complex and include various acoustic features that relate to one another, such as their echotexture and position in the image. The correct characterisation of an image may even include features that extend across frames.\nOnce training is complete, the model doesn’t ‘relearn’ each time it gets a new prompt; instead, it leverages its pre-learned knowledge to respond in real time. It does this quickly because it’s designed to process information in parallel rather than sequentially, making it highly efficient.

    "text": "Professional Context – AI’s Role in Sonography Practice\nPredicting how this technology will ultimately impact the sonographer’s role is challenging. Some tools may work in the background to improve image quality but others will require direct interactions with the sonographer. Suppose one were to view AI from a purely technical or capability standpoint – for example, a system that employs machine learning to predict an output from text, images, audio or video. With the current level of AI technology, it is perhaps reasonable to suggest that, in a short period, an ultrasound system will be equipped with advanced image analysis tools, possibly automatically labelling anatomy and highlighting a range of pathologies. Further, it may be able to analyse sets of images or videos and compute a report. Regarding audio, perhaps our machines may be equipped with an inbuilt audio interface that will interact with the patient directly, reassuring them that everything is in hand and answering any questions they may have in a professional, empathetic tone. The system may even prompt you if the patient mentions some relevant clinical history, conveniently prefilling these details into an electronic worksheet before you have left the room. What about wholly automated systems using advanced robotics?\nThe world was promised the widespread adoption of driverless cars; Morgan Stanley in 2013 predicted this would occur in 20263. Current predictions have now gone beyond another two decades. This is partly due to the messiness and unpredictability of real life and the difficulty of designing models to cope. In the case of driverless cars, sudden changes in the weather, roadworks, and, of course, other human drivers engage in irrational behaviour on the road. Healthcare is similarly complex, filled with ambiguity, human emotion, and multiple competing elements. AI models must be robust enough to handle these realities. In sonography, this means dealing with everyday realities like extremes of body habitus, low patient acuity, and challenging patient interactions. Sonographers currently address these issues using techniques such as non-standardised plans and advanced communication skills tailored to each patient’s condition and clinical history.\n3 Shanker R, et al. Autonomous cars: Self-driving the new auto industry paradigm. Morgan Stanley blue paper, 2013; 1–109.Various systems will be developed and deployed as technology advances. Following how these systems are implemented and adapted to current healthcare challenges will be interesting. What is clear is that AI systems that make predictions or assist with decision-making cannot be viewed simply in a transactional sense; they are not like calculators involving a simple input and output; it is an interaction that consists of a relationship between the user and the patient (both humans) and the machine. As mentioned above, the success of these systems will be dependent on various patient characteristics but also on how AI relates to individual practitioners. This is about knowing if the tool produces the correct response in the correct setting. In this way, the success of the AI will depend on the practitioner’s experience just as much as its ability to interpret the ultrasound machine’s output. In one scenario, an expert sonographer may quickly identify an error in the AI output, whereas a student or newly qualified sonographer may take the output on trust. AI interactions will require a delicate balance between trust and scepticism. Successfully integrating AI into sonography will mean navigating this new reality."

    "text": "Sonography Education – Balancing AI Tools and Integrity\nThe impacts of AI in the sonography profession are likely to be gradual. However, their effect on education, including sonography education, has more immediate implications. Generative AI (GenAI), the term used to describe AI that can create new content, is capable of completing many student tasks with high accuracy, making it one of the most disruptive technologies ever seen in education. The latest ChatGPT release, o1-preview, designed explicitly for advanced logic and reasoning, is reported to perform at the PhD level4.\n4 OpenAI. Introducing OpenAI o1-preview. https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/5 Parliament of Australia. Inquiry into the use of generative artificial intelligence in the Australian education system ‘Study Buddy or Influencer’. 2024 https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Employment_Education_and_Training/AIineducation/Report6 Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. Artificial intelligence request for information – next steps. 2024.https://www.teqsa.gov.au/about-us/news-and-events/latest-news/artificial-intelligence-request-information-next-stepsMultiple authorities are wrestling with the impacts. A parliamentary senate inquiry report, ‘Study Buddy or Influencer’, was released in August 2024, recommending GenAI in education be made a national priority5. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), the national regulatory body of universities, has requested urgent action, asking all institutions to report on how they manage GenAI, particularly how they address the risk of GenAI to award integrity6.\nUniversities themselves also understand the reputational risks and potential for significant community backlash, for example, graduates from a particular university who enter the workforce without the competence to perform the job effectively and safely. This is especially critical in fields like sonography and other health degrees, where universities self-certify their students. Once they graduate, there is no post-qualification check to ensure that the skills they reportedly gained meet community expectations.\nWith these considerations in mind and TEQSA having one eye firmly on risk, an urgent overhaul of assessment practices is underway. Of course, some assessments are designed to assist and promote learning, and AI tools will become welcome additions. Other, high-stakes assessments designed to verify student learning, which directly leads to certifying a degree like sonography, will require rigorous direct supervision – for example, a return of traditional hall-style written exams to verify knowledge acquisition, oral assessment tasks to demonstrate understanding and showcase communication skills, and face-to-face practical evaluations to demonstrate technical skills.\nMany online assessment methods developed during COVID-19 are now obsolete. Numerous tips and YouTube videos are circulating on how students can use AI tools during online assessments, even when the assessor is present via Teams or Zoom. Some may have already seen videos of job candidates using AI tools to convert an employer’s questions into text responses displayed on a hidden monitor during interviews.\nRisks must be countered with rewards. In the professional world, it is not unreasonable to expect the question of why you used an AI tool to become ‘why not’, especially when there are workflow and efficiency gains and improvements to overall patient care. Therefore, it is incumbent on educators to encourage the use of tools for relevant tasks. In the sonography context, this might be written communication tasks where students produce artefacts (reports, oral case presentations, ePoster) to showcase and share their knowledge with colleagues.\nThe use of AI in learning is also an untapped resource. Feedback literacy, an emerging topic in education to improve student learning outcomes, is one area in which AI may assist. The idea focuses not on how supervisors frame feedback for students but on teaching students to respond positively and integrate feedback into their practice. Feedback comes in various forms; sometimes, it is for evaluation; other times, it is an aid to help the student improve; and at different times, it is for praise on a job well done. All of which are important for growth. How students manage their emotional responses to these three is an important skill to develop. More research is needed, but perhaps AI chatbots may be a good source of feedback literacy development – just a thought.\nAs AI becomes more integrated into sonography and education, the focus must remain on maintaining the integrity of the profession and upholding community trust in practitioners. While these tools offer potential, ensuring that they enhance rather than replace human judgement and accountability is essential to preserving the core values of patient care and professional competence."

    "text": "QUT Gardens Point Campus - Brisbane Australia\nMost years, I will discuss concerns regarding a student with a department or supervisor. At times these are work-related and a larger puzzle involving interpersonal issues. At other times it relates directly to the profession and the fundamental roles and responsibilities. The student appears motivated and fits into the team well; however, they are just not clicking with the science and “art” that good sonographic practice requires. The student appears to be making the same mistakes, even after various interventions. Often, I believe this requires a responsibility from the student to better reflect on the job and let go of some past experiences in other professions. Ultrasound is different even when compared to other complementary imaging modalities. Sometimes adapting to this new environment can be a challenge.\nSo, what advice would I give to students commencing this journey? Both academically and practically.

The combination of psychomotor, cognitive clinical reasoning and communication skills is unique to the profession, requiring significant training. It isn’t easy to return to being a little fish as an adult. Success, however, will only come if you are prepared to give in and embrace the learning process. Just because you have excelled in another discipline does not mean you will be ahead of the curve. At times you need to focus hard and challenge yourself to force the mental adaptations to move to the next level. This is uncomfortable and will expose vulnerabilities. It will be painful and dint the ego, but a necessity."

    "text": "2. Seek excellence, not mastery.\nMastery is a myth, and even the greats will say there are always aspects of their profession, sport, or art they can improve. Develop a willingness to push the boundaries continuously and strive for improvement. Research in the field of skills development identifies a risk of plateauing after a certain level, as individuals become “comfortable” (Ericsson 2008). Embrace professional growth now and throughout your careers. Observe those colleagues you admire in the profession. Undoubtedly, you will find good practice routines, a deep enjoyment in what they do, and a general curiosity in medicine and healthcare. Talent or magic is not part of the equation.\n\nEricsson, K. A. 2008. “Deliberate Practice and Acquisition of Expert Performance: A General Overview.” Journal Article. Acad Emerg Med 15 (11): 988–94. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00227.x."

    "text": "3. Become a technology expert.\nGood sonographers should strive to be experts in the technology they use. Image optimisation is at the heart of what we do, and a good exam is a synergy between what both hands are doing. One is scanning the patient, the other constantly striving to improve image quality. It is not like a stethoscope, and such analogies should be left to other groups with disparate needs or avoided entirely. Sonographers are coupled to the technology in which success is predicated on a fundamental understanding of correct optimisation strategies. Get to the heart of how the technology works and understand fully what all those wonderful buttons on the machine actually do. Search the settings on your device, setup up your own pre-sets and make the machine sing. You are trying to tell a story for each exam, and the best storytellers utilised good cinematography. A picture tells a thousand words. Suppose you don’t know what a particular setting does or how it should be optimised. Ask! A good source is your friendly applications specialist. They have access to excellent resources and white papers that provide analysis on many elements of the technology."

    "text": "4. Develop a flexible systematic scanning approach (with a dash of healthy scepticism)\nUltrasound imaging is not simply a procedure requiring a series of pre-determined tasks to be completed in sequence. Imaging protocols only provide a framework. Too often, a student can miss the forest for trees. Listen to what your patient says, ask them, “why they came into the department today?”. Does their answer line up with the imaging request? Is there a need to extend the examination or focus more on one aspect? Sonographers need to adapt and be flexible to best answer the clinical question, using alternative image modes, transducers, or variations to the usual patient positioning maneuvers. Even advanced communication skills are the difference between the success or failure of the exam. In a recent article on the impacts of AI, it became clear to my colleagues and me that many elements of what a sonographer does will be difficult for machines to replicate (Edwards et al. 2022). Many are unique to human cognitive understanding and common-sense reasoning. Be systematic in the approach to each organ or region and be critical in the observations you make. Ask yourself if what you are seeing is a true reflection of reality. Ultrasound images are tricky to interpret at times, and a healthy dash of scepticism may alert you to an artifact rather than a significant pathology. Re-read point 3 above.\n\nEdwards, C., C. Chamunyonga, B. Searle, and T. Reddan. 2022. “The Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Sonography Profession: Professional and Educational Considerations.” Journal Article.

    "text": "5. Embrace your peers\nPostgraduate ultrasound education should not be viewed as a top-down approach. Learning will not flow exclusively from your supervisors or lecturers at university. Some of the best advice will come from other students or recent graduates. These people often provide a more nuanced or relatable interpretation of the learning process. A sonographer with 30 years of experience is a wealth of knowledge, but at times, that lightbulb moment will come from a fellow student that explains something at your level. The importance of peer learning is increasingly being embedded into postgraduate university programs and has benefits beyond the traditional lecturer–student relationship. Employing students as partners promotes metacognition and a sense of interconnectedness. Form a study group and actively engage other students in your program. Also, be confident that your ideas and interpretations matter; a good supervisor/teacher enjoys both teaching and learning from their students."

Regularly engage your colleagues, and if there is an element you would like assistance with, ask for it! Ultrasound departments are hectic, complex environments and students need to use their initiative to enhance their training. Ultrasound training is a privilege and a fantastic opportunity few people get. Don’t remain a passive observer; help out where you can when times are busy, and use your time wisely during quiet periods. Seek feedback from all members of the health care team. Learn from radiologists, cardiologists and other imaging specialists, talk to referrers and gain insights from a wide network."

Success will require you to manage these in the short term to realise your long-term goals. However, there must be an element of enjoyment in what you do. Struggling in a profession that you learn is the wrong fit has no benefit. The investment in a single student for a department is massive. It won’t take long to understand what is required and what the future holds. If you realise the career is not for you, step away and pursue something better suited. There is no shame in this, and it demonstrates a level of insight and maturity."

    "text": "8. Be a scholar\nAs a university student, read the academic literature and think critically about what you have read. Read full-text articles and don’t simply rely on headlines distilling the virtues of ultrasound. Ultrasound technology does not need to be marketed. It needs to be understood. It is not without its flaws and has many. Understand the limitations and advantages, when it should be employed to improve patient care and when to be avoided. Engage with your professional bodies such as ASA and ASUM. But also challenge them to promote factually correct information backed by peer-reviewed research. If an organisation shares information, check who wrote it and search out and read the research paper. A good paper will discuss any limitations missed in the headline. For example, “the participants in the study were trained athletes and do not represent the broader population”. If a link does not contain direct access to the entire research paper, ask for it or search directly and share it. Suppose the journal paper is behind a pay-wall. In that case, university research repositories, such as QUT ePrints, or national databases such as PubMed.gov often have agreements with the publisher to provide full-text approved versions of papers."

There will be periods where nothing seems to stick, and at others, we hit a period of solid progress, and everything is clicking into gear. Volume and “time in the saddle” are essential components. Consistent regular practice will always trump blocks of training in the long term. Avoid long periods away and line up your periods of academic work with clinical experience. The aim is to embed a deep understanding of the profession. Competency is not an independent list of skills and knowledge; it combines these."

A combination of both is required for long term growth and improvement. Even God rested on the seventh day. Exercise and a good diet also play a part, and both have broad health benefits."
